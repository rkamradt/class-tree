Classification Tree
===============

Create a tree that represents a classification hierarchy. Reads a JSON file that contains a single array of strings. The strings are of format type>subtype>subsubtype...etc. The tree can then be searched along the taxonomy for the subtree that defines the sub types, and can also return a total count of sub types.

Prerequisites:

    * Node
    * Grunt cli (to run tests)

To run tests:

```sh
grunt test
```
